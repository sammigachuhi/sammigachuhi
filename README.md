- 👋 Hi, I’m @sammigachuhi
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, something new that just came up in my latter half of 20s
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to programme in R Studio, started Python as a fresher this year and feeling stretched to learn GEE java because I am a GIS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, let's wait and see because I have changed things too many times in the past few years!
- 📫 How to reach me - for now, let's do with email - sammigachuhi@gmail.com. That's until when I can trust you to leave you with my phone number.
